## Overview

In this project I mainly needed to focus on page layout, page responsiveness and APP functionality.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

1. Create initial project using React JS
2. Create background for the APP
3. Create title and IP / Domain search bar
4. Create GeoLocation results display
5. Create Leaflet JS generated map
6. Implement IPify connection to the project

### Built with

- React JS
- Node JS
- Leaflet JS
- IPify
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile first approach
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- GitFlow workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, the main challenge that I overcame was to create React Js Functionality for the APP. After research and practicing different ways for resolving necessary steps, I wrote the code, that worked eventually and it gave me some confidence and knowledge of making APPs interactive, dynamic and functional.

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master coding and make more dynamic, interactive and functional projects.
